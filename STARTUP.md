QuPath v0.2.0-m1
================

Greetings from QuPath v0.2.0-m1!

You can read more about what is different at https://qupath.github.io/

## Things you should know:
* This is a milestone release, not a finished version!
* You can use milestone releases to try out new features - but be aware that the software is changing.
* It is *not* a good idea to mix this with older versions (e.g. QuPath v0.1.2). Data files and projects saved with this version might not be compatible.
* It's still possible to open old projects and data files, but because of the risk of making them incompatible it's best to avoid it (or at least make sure you have backups first).
