## Version 0.0.2

* New Help menu links to online resources
* Source code now included for dependencies (from Maven)
* 'Objects -> Create full image annotation' command is now scriptable
* Error notification now displayed if an image can't be opened
* Extension ClassLoader changes to help add dependencies (without copying or symbolic linking)
* Fixed some weird behavior when multiple images are contained in the same file


## Version 0.0.1-beta

* First available version under GPL.  Arguably with an overly-conservative version number.
