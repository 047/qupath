Eclipse's .classpath files aren't included in git any more (although .project files remain).
If yours gets lost, you can try taking the classpath file from this directory and put it into qupath-main, remaining it to .classpath

Maven -> Update Project should take care of the other class paths, only qupath-main is more awkward.
